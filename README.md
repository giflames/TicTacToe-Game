# Tic-Tac-Toe Game in C#

This repository hosts a simple yet engaging Tic-Tac-Toe game developed as part of my journey in learning object-oriented programming with C#. It was inspired by a tutorial on YouTube, which you can watch [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ffSCMF8SHE&t=160s).

## Introduction

As a programming enthusiast, I embarked on this project to enhance my grasp of object-oriented principles in C#. 
The game is a classic implementation of Tic-Tac-Toe, providing players with an opportunity to hone their strategic skills while offering me a practical platform to apply my OOP knowledge. 

The game was developed in console application and demonstrates the use of classes to create a modular and extensible codebase. Feel free to explore the source code, provide feedback, or use it as a reference for your own OOP projects in C#.
